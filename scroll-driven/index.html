        <p>Until recently, I wasn't aware of the distinct role known as "Design Engineering." For the past few years, I've been a liaison between the creative and software engineering teams, effectively bridging their disciplines. I provide guidance to graphic designers on branding, art direction, and occasionally assist with elements like vectors, layouts, and fonts. Simultaneously, I collaborate closely with developers to understand real-time functionality and other project requirements. This naturally evolved from my inclination towards mediating between groups and a genuine aversion to conflicts, driven by my empathy for others.</p>

          In the tech circles I frequent, particularly among "design engineers," the sentiment often echoes: "Coding finds its purpose in visual output; design brings it to life." Personally, I find it hard to separate the two; how can we construct something meaningful without design? Much like in carpentry, where planning, scaling, and design precede the actual crafting process, web development requires a similar approach. It's a branch of computer science that yields tangible results - websites and apps for real users. Then there are those rare individuals who effortlessly straddle both worlds, sometimes referred to as "tech unicorns" or simply "design engineers" (a term that can be ambiguous).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          These professionals seamlessly blend these roles, refusing to compartmentalize them. After all, a design concept necessitates engineering, and any engineering idea craves a design framework.
