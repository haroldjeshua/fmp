        <h2>Design Engineering</h2>
        <p>Until recently, I wasn't aware of the distinct role known as "Design Engineering." For the past few years, I've been a liaison between the creative and software engineering teams, effectively bridging their disciplines. I provide guidance to graphic designers on branding, art direction, and occasionally assist with elements like vectors, layouts, and fonts. Simultaneously, I collaborate closely with developers to understand real-time functionality and other project requirements. This naturally evolved from my inclination towards mediating between groups and a genuine aversion to conflicts, driven by my empathy for others.</p>
        
        <p>
          In the tech circles I frequent, particularly among "design engineers," the sentiment often echoes: "Coding finds its purpose in visual output; design brings it to life." Personally, I find it hard to separate the two; how can we construct something meaningful without design? Much like in carpentry, where planning, scaling, and design precede the actual crafting process, web development requires a similar approach. It's a branch of computer science that yields tangible results - websites and apps for real users. Then there are those rare individuals who effortlessly straddle both worlds, sometimes referred to as "tech unicorns" or simply "design engineers" (a term that can be ambiguous).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          These professionals seamlessly blend these roles, refusing to compartmentalize them. After all, a design concept necessitates engineering, and any engineering idea craves a design framework.

        <h2>Sketchboi</h2>
        <p>Naaalala ko lang dito sa mga sketches and drawings ko is at that time, solo ako, peaceful, no worries, all I was thinking is I wanna let all these ideas inside my head and put it to life. Not to prove something or to someone, just you know, build something useful, not for only myself but also people around me. Like what problem could it solve and what help I can offer etc etc mga ganong ka-ek ekan.</p>
        
        <p>And mostly sometimes, I gaslight myself why I let myself get affected by my environment, by the people around me, by the negative energy that surrounds me, na if I wasn't got entangled with all this crap, I should have done so much by now, I could have build all these things I was keep on talking about and not doing about it.</p>
        
        <p>I have learned a lot of lessons by now, pero minsan, all I can say "Tama na Rold sa lessons, gusto ko na Po sumaya at mapayapa."</p>
        
        <p>Ah basta ganto na lang: <br/>
      "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now". <br/>
